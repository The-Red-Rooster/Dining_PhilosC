# Dining_PhilosC
A basic implementation of the Dining Philosophers program implemented in the C language. This uses system calls and does not utilize threads. For a more "optimized" version, please see the repository here: https://github.com/The-Red-Rooster/Threaded_PhilosC

This repository includes a zip file of the entire program as well as loose files that can be viewable on-site.
This was an assignment in the Systems Programming class CS360 at WSU, 2020.
